# MMAC_LaTIM_Solution


Here's the [LaTIM](https://latim.univ-brest.fr/) team's solution in the [MICCAI MMAC 2023 Challenge](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/12477#learn_the_details-overview).

We are the **TOP 8** of the Task 1-Classification of myopic maculopathy, the **TOP 2** of the Task 2-Segmentation of myopic maculopathy plus lesions, and the **TOP 1** of the Task 3-Prediction of spherical equivalent. 

If you use our code please cite: [Automated Detection of Myopic Maculopathy in MMAC 2023: Achievements in Classification, Segmentation, and Spherical Equivalent Prediction]().
